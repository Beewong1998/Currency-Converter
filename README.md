Chrome extension for converting currencies

Purpose of Project: To make a clean looking currency exchange extension that can be easily accessed. I wanted to add some levels of customisation to the application to make it more personalised to each user.

Problems and fixes: The background colours resetted everytime you reopened the app. This was fixed after I learnt about local storage which I then implemented to my code.

Future improvements: Add all currencies Add favourite currencies
